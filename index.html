        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Ivaltiano was established by Ivalt Sello Sekhaolelo on 24/03/2024. The inspiration behind the
             establishment of the brand Ivaltiano came through designing a brand and Logo for another 
             potential businessperson. “I had a version to establish a place where people will come and 
             get 360 degrees Satisfying and fulfilling customer service, without feeling a need to go else
              to fill a void on a particular day. The dream vison is meet all daily needs of a customer 
              at one place.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p> People do not mind spending; they just want to spend where they will see value for their 
            expenditure”. Ivaltiano is aiming to meet the following customer services: Salon (Hair, Make-up, 
            Nails), Spa (Massage, and related treatments), Designer clothing (Custom made fashion clothes),  
            Restaurant (Serving variety of food and beverages at a classic level with good live music 
            experience), conference halls ( Hosting events as per customer preference, e.g. Year End 
            functions, Business Seminars, Birthday Parties, Indoor weddings etc.,), Butchery,  Gaden Events 
            (Catering outdoors weddings and parties, outdoor events, and Picnics), and a Lodge (After all 
            these activities people need a place to rest with comfort and security).</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Ivaltino target young adults, Middle age groups, and pensioners. This is for people who has the 
            will and spending power. The service is classic, elegant and first class. Our target market is 
            people who are from local, national, and International. It’s not easy to discern people, however 
            cleanliness, morality and discipline, responsibility are the core values of our business.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Every time I came across something that looked like my vision I got steered up and became eager 
            to achieve this goal. I got the motivation from places like Max’s Lifestyle in Durban South 
            Africa, Indaba Hotel, Spa rand Conference Center. Growing up from a family where there is no 
            legacy nor Investments, and the desire to live free from a 9-5 lifestyle is one inspiration 
            amongst others.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>The Aim is to give people a sense of belonging, meeting the physical, mental, Emotional, and 
            spiritual needs. Bring people together for a good purpose, inspire growth and development.  
            Addressing Issues of Unemployment amongst surrounding communities and providing people with 
            quality and valuable skills they can use to enhance themselves. </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Our operation will be at one specific place and will expand to another when there is a huge need 
            to fill the gap. Being at one place keeps the spark and the and originality of the establishment.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Our Marketing strategy will be through social media, Business website and a word of Mouth. </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>We would like to categorize our business as unique through our standard of operation, quality of 
            service, and our values; therefore, our competition is us. </p>
